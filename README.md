# Rainfall Prediction Project

This project aims to predict rainfall in millimeters using a Support Vector Regressor (SVR) machine learning model. The backend is built with Flask, providing an API endpoint for making predictions.

## Features

- Predict rainfall in millimeters based on input parameters
- RESTful API built with Flask
- Support Vector Regressor model for accurate predictions
- Easy-to-use interface for making predictions

## INCULSIONS 
1. extended_rainfall_dataset.csv: Dataset used for the prediction
2. Rainfall_Prediction.ipynb: The python notebook file that was used for,
        ->Data Loading and Exploration
        ->Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
        ->Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
        ->Model Selection and Training
        ->Model Evaluation and Interpretation
        ->Conclusion and Future Work
3. static\styles.css: Holds the designing for the prediction website.
4. templates\index.html: Holds the html structure of the prediction website.
5. SVRModel.pkl: The pickle file of the model trained.
6. requirements.txt: The data of the required modules to be installed before executing the file.
7. app.py: The flask application, which holds the backend of the prediciton website.
